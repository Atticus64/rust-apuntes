// ownership es una feature unica de Rust
// y tiene profundas implicaciones en el lenguaje

// que es la ownership?
/*
Ownership is a set of rules that governs
how a Rust program manages memory.
All programs have to manage the way
they use a computerâ€™s memory while running
*/

// Reglas del ownership
// 1. Each value in Rust has an owner.
// 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
// 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped
pub fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function...
                        // ... and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5; // x comes into scope

    makes_copy(x);
} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But because s's value was moved, nothing
  // special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {
    // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) {
    // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
